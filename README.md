Repo where I follow along the [**"Learning Live with AWS & HashiCorp"**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL81sUbsFNc5bYnjraNpivm1XxR3WNM_Kd) series.

- [Part 1](https://github.com/hashicorp/microservices-architecture-on-aws/tree/part-1) - Setting up the Terraform project and creating a VPC

**Concepts I enjoyed learning about:**

- default tags
- built-in functions (cidrsubnet & element)
- meta-arguments (count, depends_on)

- [Part 2](https://github.com/hashicorp/microservices-architecture-on-aws/tree/part-2) - Creating your first containerized microservice on Amazon ECS with Terraform
